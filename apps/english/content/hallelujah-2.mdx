[Verse 1]
         G                   Em
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
     G                      Em
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
    C                D                   G    D
But you don't really care for music, do you?
   G                  C           D
It goes like this the fourth, the fifth
    Em              C
The minor fall, the major lift
    D               B7          Em
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
     C           Em          C           G  D G  D
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah
 \n
[Verse 2]
     G                         Em
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
    G               Em
You saw her bathing on the roof
    C              D             G        D
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
    G             C       D
She tied you to a kitchen chair
    Em                         C
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
    D                  B7            Em
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
     C           Em          C           G  D G  D
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah
 \n
[Verse 3]
    G              Em
You say I took the name in vain
G            Em
I don't even know the name
    C              D                 G      D
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
          G                 C     D
There's a blaze of light in every word
   Em             C
It doesn't matter which you heard
    D           B7          Em
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
     C           Em          C           G  D G  D
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah
 \n
[Verse 4]
  G               Em
I did my best, it wasn't much
  G                   Em
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
     C                 D                    G   D
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
    G              C        D
And even though it all went wrong
     Em               C
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
     D             B7              Em
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
 \n
[Outro]
     C           Em          C           G D
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     C           Em          C           G D
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     C           Em          C           G D
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     C           Em          C           G D G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
