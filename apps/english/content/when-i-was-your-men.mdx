[Intro]
D7  Dm  C
D7  Dm  C  G/B
\n
[Verse 1]
Am               C                       Dm
Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
G               G7                  C              Em/B
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
Am                    C                             Dm
When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
G                                     C
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
\n
[Refrain]
   Em                   Am              Em
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh
Bb                             C/G
Mmm too young, too dumb to realize
\n
[Chorus]
     G                      F      G              C
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
                        F    G          C
Shoulda gave you all my hours when I had the chance
                  F                   G                Am
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
D7            F                  Fm                   C     F C   Em/B
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man
\n
[Verse 2]
Am           C                    Dm
My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
G                    G7                     C           Em/B
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
         Am     C                         Dm
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made ooh
G                                    C
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
\n
[Refrain]
   Em/B                 Am              Em
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh
Bb                             C/G
Mmm too young, too dumb to realize
\n
[Chorus]
     G                      F      G              C
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
                        F    G          C
Shoulda gave you all my hours when I had the chance
                  F                   G                Am
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
D7            F                  Fm                   C
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man
\n
[Bridge]
            F                 G                       C G/B Am Em/G
Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
      D7
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
           Dm
To try and apologize for my mistakes
           G
But I just want you to know
\n
[Chorus]
                   F      G                      C
I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand
                 F    G           C
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
                  F             G                     Am
Take you to every party cause I remember how much you love to dance
D7                  F             Fm               C
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
D7                  F             Fm               C
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
